# dfurl

Defer and rule.

## Why?

You do your best work offline. Your team needs online. Ever wondered how to solve this dilemma? The solution is to use tools that work offline but also support [asychronous communication](https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat/) and synchronisation when online. With the [dat protocol](https://datprotocol.org) and [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com) it has become easier than ever to build reliable tools to do just that.

This project provides some common utilities to build these kinds of applications. It grew out of, and is heavily used by [dterm](https://dterm.hashbase.io/docs).

## How?

At the moment, I'm still iterating over the API of `dfurl` while developing the first few reference apps. When things have stabilized, I'll document this project and post the link here.
